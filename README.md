# Matplotlib-Homework

The goal of this challenge was to use Pandas and Matplotlib coding in order to analyse the data of certain drugs tested on mice and their tumor volume over time.

Files included in this challenge: Mouse_metadata.csv, Study_results.csv

Dependancies used: matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, scipy.stats, and numpy

My Observations and Insights are located at the top of the analysis Notebook.

My main takeaway from this project is that both Pandas and Matplotlib are very useful tools when wanting to organize and summarize data. Also, they both offer good, easy to use, display options in order to present the data in a concise, easy to read/analyse format.

The primary challenge I had with this challenge was organizing the data by last timepoint in the order requested on on homework. I found some alternative methods that were more efficient to find this data so it took me some time to figure out how to do it in the order requested.
